/**
 * Reports whether an item is a pursuit the selected character already holds.
 *
 * A pursuit - quest, bounty, token - is unique per character: the vendor offers it once and holds
 * it until it is completed or abandoned. Two kinds of item are deliberately not pursuits, because
 * holding several of each is legitimate:
 *
 * - **Gear**, told apart by carrying an equipment slot. Several of one weapon is normal.
 * - **Consumables and materials**, told apart by declaring a stack larger than one.
 *
 * The stack size is what separates the second group, *not* the instanced state. A pursuit carries
 * no instance data either, so it is marked stackable exactly as a consumable is, and testing that
 * flag let every quest through - three copies of one bounty in the tab. Every classification is
 * logged as `ev=pursuit stage=classify` so this stays settled by data rather than by assumption.
 *
 * This lives in State rather than beside its caller because the rule is not the Web Service's own:
 * it mirrors the classification the client's native vendor-row gate applies locally when it decides
 * whether a row is still offered, and the two must not drift. A row still offered for an item the
 * grant would refuse is the bug it exists to prevent.
 *
 * @param itemDefinitionIndex Item to classify.
 * @return True when this is a pursuit the selected character already holds.

 *
 * @param account Account view to test against.
